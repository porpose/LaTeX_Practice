# LaTeX Practice

By porpose

### Introduction
I write these LaTeX codes as practice of techniques used in LaTeX. This report was orginally written by using Microsoft Word as an assignment of my introductory physics course. I converted it to LaTeX format to help myself better understand LaTeX.

### Setup
- Download the source code from [here](https://github.com/porpose/LaTeX_Practice.git).
- Compile main_tex, preferably in pdfLaTeX.
- You should see a pdf file that is identical to the demo file.
